A smartphone-based system to passively track a user's level of intoxication via accelerometer signals to support the delivery of mobile just-in-time adaptive interventions during heavy drinking events was studied. 
Smartphone accelerometer readings and transdermal alcohol content (TAC) for 13 subjects in an alcohol consumption study were analyzed. 
The study used non-sensitive accelerometer data to detect periods of heavy drinking. 
Permutation entropy and complexity method was tested to check if it is reliable in differentiating heavy drinking vs. sober cases.
