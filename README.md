A smartphone-based system to passively track a user's level of intoxication via accelerometer signals to support the delivery of mobile just-in-time adaptive interventions during heavy drinking events. 
Smartphone accelerometer readings and transdermal alcohol content (TAC) for 13 subjects in an alcohol consumption study were analyzed. 
The study used non-sensitive accelerometer data to detect periods of heavy drinking.
